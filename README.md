## How to run the app

### Frontend

To run the application, go to `frontend` folder and run:
- `npm i`
- `npm run start`

This will open the project in http://localhost:3000/


### Backend

As this variation of the app uses dummy users from https://dummyjson.com/, it does not contain any backend functionalities.
